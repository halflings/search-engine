# grep the web

A "search engine" _ahum_ built from the ground up.

## Goals

The goal isn't to make the fastest, most robust and reliable search engine ever (everybody knows _AltaVista_ did that already) as much as to write a simple and elegant search engine.

I already implemented a search engine for binary queries (with postings list in linked-lists) in Java, and those search engines are not common nowadays so I think I'll focus on implementing a decent full-text search engine using TF-IDF to describe each documents and query.
